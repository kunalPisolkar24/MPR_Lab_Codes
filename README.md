Welcome to the Assembly Language Microprocessor Lab repository for Savitribai Phule Pune University! This repository contains a collection of practical codes for the Microprocessor Laboratory course (210257) in the Second Year of Computer Engineering (2019 Course). Let's explore the world of microprocessors and assembly language programming together! :rocket:

üìú **Course Information:**  

- **University:** Savitribai Phule Pune University
- **Course Name:** Microprocessor Laboratory (210257)
- **Companion Course:** Microprocessor (210254)
- **Course Objectives:**
  - To understand assembly language programming instruction set
  - To understand different assembler directives with examples
  - To apply instruction set for implementing X86/64 bit assembly language programs
- **Course Outcomes:**
  - CO1. Understand and apply various addressing modes and instruction set to implement assembly language programs
  - CO2. Apply logic to implement code conversion
  - CO3. Analyze and apply logic to demonstrate processor mode of operation

üéØ **Course Topics Covered:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Write an X86/64 ALP to accept five 64-bit Hexadecimal numbers from the user and store them in an array and display the accepted numbers. |
| 2 | Write an X86/64 ALP to accept a string and display its length. |
| 3 | Write an X86/64 ALP to find the largest of given Byte/Word/Dword/64-bit numbers. |
| 4 | Write an X86/64 ALP to count the number of positive and negative numbers from the array. |
| 5 | Write X86/64 ALP to convert 4-digit Hex number into its equivalent BCD number and 5-digit BCD number into its equivalent HEX number. Make your program user-friendly to accept the choice from the user for: (a) HEX to BCD (b) BCD to HEX (c) EXIT. Display proper strings to prompt the user while accepting the input and displaying the result. (Wherever necessary, use 64-bit registers). |
| 6 | Write X86/64 ALP to detect protected mode and display the values of GDTR, LDTR, IDTR, TR, and MSW Registers. |
| 7 | Write X86/64 ALP to perform non-overlapped block transfer without string-specific instructions. The block containing data can be defined in the data segment. |
| 8 | Write X86/64 ALP to perform overlapped block transfer with string-specific instructions. The block containing data can be defined in the data segment. |
| 9 | Write X86/64 ALP to perform multiplication of two 8-bit hexadecimal numbers. Use successive addition and add and shift method. |
| 10 | Write x86 ALP to find the factorial of a given integer number on the command line by using recursion. Explicit stack manipulation is expected in the code. |
